# Resource Meta

An [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) module for adding `<meta>` tags to resources.

With this module, administrators can map resource properties to [metadata elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta).
This is helpful for web indexing and search engine optimization (SEO), making your
public resources more richly described and discoverable.
